Project Proposal: Swiss Chalet Delivery Manager
Name
Swiss Chalet Delivery Manager
Introduction
The Swiss Chalet Delivery Manager is a mobile app designed to streamline the delivery process for drivers working with Swiss Chalet. The app aims to provide drivers with real-time information about their delivery orders, including the time remaining before an order becomes free if delivered late. The current system lacks features that allow drivers to efficiently manage their deliveries and track remaining delivery times. This app will improve efficiency and customer satisfaction by ensuring timely deliveries.
