**Project Proposal: Swiss Chalet Delivery Manager**

**Name**

**Swiss Chalet Delivery Manager**

**Introduction**

The Swiss Chalet Delivery Manager is a mobile app designed to streamline the delivery process for drivers working with Swiss Chalet. The app aims to provide drivers with real-time information about their delivery orders, including the time remaining before an order becomes free if delivered late. The current system lacks features that allow drivers to efficiently manage their deliveries and track remaining delivery times. This app will improve efficiency and customer satisfaction by ensuring timely deliveries.

**General Functionality**

- **Order Notifications**: Receive notifications for new delivery orders assigned to the driver.
- **Order Details**: View detailed information about each order, including customer name, address, order time, and items.
- **Real-Time Countdown**: Display a countdown timer indicating the time remaining before the order is considered late.
- **Order Status Updates**: Mark orders as "Out for Delivery" and "Delivered" with timestamps.
- **Route Optimization**: Integrate with navigation apps to provide optimized routes for multiple deliveries.
- **Customer Feedback**: Allow customers to provide feedback on the delivery experience directly within the app.
- **Order History**: Maintain a history of delivered orders for reference and record-keeping.
